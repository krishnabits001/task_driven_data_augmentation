Use N4_th executable file given here to perform the Bias Correction of any input file.

After downloading "N4_th" file, change the file to be executable using: chmod +x N4_th
The bias correction usage command is:
./N4_th <input_image_path> <output_bias_corrected_image_path> <threshold_value>
Example, if threshold value is 0.001:
./N4_th input_image.nii output_image.nii 0.001

input_image.nii --> is the image with bias fields
output_image.nii --> is the bias corrected image

For the ACDC dataset, we used the threshold value of 0.001, fitting levels as 4, no. of iterations as 50, and did not use any mask information.

If you want to alter the above values like fitting levels, no. of iterations and others, please check the below link with sample code:
